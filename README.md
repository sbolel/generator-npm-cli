# `npm` module with a CLI

An _in-progress_ generator template for a global npm module with command-line tools (CLI).

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/), which can both be installed by following the instructions on https://nodejs.org/. Installing Node.js also installs npm.

> The command line tools require Node.js version 0.10.0 or greater.

Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can install the command-line tools via npm:

#### Building from source

`git clone https://bitbucket.org/sbolel/generator-npm-cli-module` - Clone repo & `cd` into directory.

`npm build` - Run this command in the cloned directory to build from the source (runs `npm install -g ./`).
